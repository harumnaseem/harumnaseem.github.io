                                This was done by my group as part of the Data Science course final project.
                                The dataset was chosen on Suicide Rates between the years 1985–2016, available on Kaggle, to 
                                draw inferences and develop models.
                                The aim of our project was to find 
                                and explore different sort of trends and correlations that could help us 
                                understand the changing patterns of suicide and in different countries. 
                                Through our analysis, we wanted to be able to identify the factors that 
                                may be related to suicide rates across a socioeconomic spectrum and 
                                can help organizations improve suicide prevention methods.
