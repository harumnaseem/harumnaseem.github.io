              <p>I formed this student-run society to support, encourage, and mentor females to pursue a degree in computing’s diverse field. With this society, I am playing my part in empowering women in computer science to succeed and thrive, in LUMS and beyond, through boot camps, networking opportunities, educational and professional events. Another primary goal is to decrease gender imbalance in Computer Science because no academic field should be male or female. I believe diversity is the key to new advancements because every individual brings in their own experiences.</p>

                  <b>Advisor:</b> Dr. Suleman Shahid (Ph.D. Tilburg University, Head of Computer-Human Interaction and Social Experience Lab at LUMS)
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Idea:</b> To support the visually impaired community through technology to make information accessible through electronic devices. In Pakistan's context, the usage of accessibility based softwares is still not as prevalent due to the lack of awareness pertaining to the existence of such softwares or the lack of knowledge concerning their use. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Solution:</b> Provided an empirical tech-based solution for this problem, a mobile application that teaches the optimal use of these accessibility based softwares using courses and tutorials. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Actionable items:</b>

                <p>
                  <b>Idea:</b> Through formal cultural consensus analysis, there is a strong agreement that the most significant impact on children and their early development is from what they visualize and learn from things they see. However, with the increased usage of the web by children, it has become more crucial than ever before for children-directed gaming websites to undergo regularisation. Some of the online gaming websites host advertisements containing sexually explicit, violent, pornographic content. In some cases, these websites also collect personally identifiable information, which is against the COPPA guidelines.

                    <li>
                      I manually documented the type of ads being shown to each persona, looking specifically for ads containing inappropriate content such as violence, nudity, sexual content, offensive language, gambling, alcohol, and drugs.

              <p>I spent a month teaching children from underprivileged backgrounds at this orphanage. I had to designs lectures according to their experience and background. Additionally, they were not as fluent in English and so I had to teach them in Urdu.
